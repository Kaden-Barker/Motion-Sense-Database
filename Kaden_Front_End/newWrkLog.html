    <h2> Trigger Execution </h2>
    <h4> Author: Kaden Barker </h4>
    <p> This page provides an example interface to show that the workoutLog_BEFORE_INSERT trigger
        is working correctly.
    </p>
    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Description: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> The before insert trigger on the workoutLog table enfores that an 
                                athlete will not complete a log for a workout that isn't available
                                on the date entered.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Justification: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> Workouts are provided over a specific time inorder to produce results.
                                It is important that athletes are only entering logs for workouts that 
                                are availble for that date range.
                            </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Execution Examples: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> In the real world the athlete would know what workout plan there completing
                                In this representation try creating a workoutLog.
                                Set the the workoutPlan number to 1, and the date to 02-07-2023.
                                After clicking submit you will see that an error occured. This is because the trigger caught
                                that the date entered is out of the range of the workout plan. Now change the completion date
                                to 01-07-2023. As you can see the entry was successfull. </p>
