    <h2> Function Execution </h2>
    <h4> Author: Kaden Barker </h4>
    <p> This page provides an example interface to show that the exerciseProgress function
        is working correctly.
    </p>
    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Description: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> The exerciseProgress fuction is designed so that an athlete or trainer can
                                search an exercise and see the progress that was made from their first time logging 
                                the exercise to their last time.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Justification: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> Athletes work with trainers to improve them selves or recover from injury. This is why it
                                is important to have a way of seeing progress. If a trainer isn't seeing enough progress in their 
                                athlete then the trainer knows that something isn't working. Similarly if an athlete isn't seeing 
                                progress then they know that they may need to find a differnent trainer. That being said this function 
                                returns progress for one exercise, however it could also be used in a procedure to generate a progress 
                                report for everything an athlete does.
                            </p>

    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Execution Examples: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> An athlete that uses this system will know there Athlete ID just as most students know their student ID. They will 
                                also know what exercises they have been doing. That being said try entering 1 for the Athlete ID and squat for the 
                                Exercise Name. You will see that athlete 1 has increased by 10 since they started working with their trainer.
                                Now try entering deadlift for the Exercise Name. You can now see that athlete 1 hasn't improved their deadlift yet.</p>
