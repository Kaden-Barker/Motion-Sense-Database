    <p> This page provides an example interface to show that the availableWorkouts Procedure
        is working correctly.
    </p>
    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Description: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> The available workouts procedure shows all workouts that an
                                athletes trainer has provided based on a given time period.</p>

    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Justification: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> It is common for trainers to provide different workouts for different 
                                days of the week. That being said it is important for an athlete to be 
                                able to view all the workouts for the time that they are searching for.
                            </p>

    <h4 style="display:inline;"> Execution Examples: </h4>
    <p style="display:inline;"> In the real world the athlete would know their
                                ID and be able to search for their workouts. In this representation try searching
                                for an athletes workouts. If you set the ID to 1, the start date to 2023-01-01, and the end
                                date to 2023-02-01. As you can see this will pull up any workouts that are available for athlete
                                1 and in provided time range. Another example to show that the procedure is working is to set the ID to 1, 
                                the start date to 2023-01-01, and the end date to 2023-01-10. As you will see this now only shows the one 
                                workout for athlete 1 that's in the time frame.</p>
