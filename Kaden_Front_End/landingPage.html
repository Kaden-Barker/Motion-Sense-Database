	<h3> Designed and Developed By: Kaden Barker, Peter Thompson </h3>
	<!-- High level database description -->
	<p> Motion Sense is a database designed for trainers and athletes to keep track of exercises and 
        progress. Athletes can make daily entries for workouts that are provided by their trainers. 
        Trainers can see the entries that their athletes make, which allows them to see progress and 
        ajust future workouts accordingly. </p>
	<!-- Links to documentation -->
	<h3> Documentation </h3>
	<p> You should include non-editable links to each of the following Google Docs: Requirements, Design, Implementation Plan.

	by name (which is not vulnerable to SQL injection), calculate the total price for items 
	in a shopping cart using a store function, print a bill for a specific cart using a 
	stored procedure, and add an employee to the database which activates a data validation
