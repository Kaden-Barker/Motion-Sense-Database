		<!-- Database project title -->
		<h1> Motion Sense </h1>
		<!-- Authors -->
		<h3> Designed and Developed By: Kaden Barker and Peter Thompson </h3>
		<!-- High level database description -->
		<p> The Motion Sense database tracks workouts and exercises performed by athletes who are
			working with trainers. First, a trainer uses the database to plan a set of workouts for
			an athlete over a certain time period. Then, the athlete uses the database to log their
			completion of those workouts on particular days. Each workout is composed of a set of
			exercises, which allows for the planning and logging of each workout in great detail.
			Finally, the database is also designed to provide access to doctors who may be working
			with athletes recovering from injury. </p>
